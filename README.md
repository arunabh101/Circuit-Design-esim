# Introduction
DAC stands for Digital to Analog Converter. It is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal. A digital to analog converter takes in digital bits as input and converts it into a corresponding analog voltage.
An n-bit DAC takes an n-bit digital input and converts it into a corresponding analog voltage level for the reference voltage.
